Hello and welcome to my corner of the web.

I'm a .NET & Azure Architect based in Flanders, Belgium, currently employed at [ZORGI](https://www.zorgi.be/) since 2021.

When I'm not occupied with work, I find enjoyment in both spectating (particularly cycling & Formula 1) and engaging in physical activities like walking, running, and cycling.
