Hello and welcome to my corner of the web.

I'm a .NET & Azure Architect based in Flanders, Belgium, currently employed at [ZORGI](https://www.zorgi.be/) since 2021.

Over the past years, I've had the privilege of engaging with a wide range of technologies and projects. My main experience lies in building .NET web applications and Azure cloud applications. Currently, my specialization is primarily in Azure in its broad sense, covering everything from cloud architecture to DevOps to platform engineering.

When I'm not occupied with work, I find enjoyment in both spectating (particularly cycling & Formula 1) and engaging in physical activities like walking, running, and cycling.
